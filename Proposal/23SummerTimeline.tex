    \subsection*{Appendix}

    Students are also required to complete a test under Teacher's inspection. A test paper will be published at the end of period. Teachers should take initiatives to arrange a test time and meet students for discussion about the result of the test, providing study plans for them.

    Students are suggested to follow the plan to do revisions, or they shall take on their initiatives to communicate with teachers in order to provide the best-suited study plan according to the HKDSE.
