        \textbf{Locus and Circle: Homework}
    \end{center}

    In this homework, we are going to solve a problem related to circle.
    
    Given two points $A(10,0), B(-10,0)$ on the rectangular coordinate plane.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Find the equation of the perpendicular bisector $L$ of the straight line $AB$, and the midpoint $M$ of $A$ and $B$. Show that $M$ is on $L$.
        \item Denote $P$ and $Q$ be points such that $P$ is equidistant from $A$ and $L$, and $Q$ is equidistant from $B$ and $L$. \begin{enumerate}
            \item Denote the locus of $P$ by $C_1$ and locus of $Q$ by $C_2$. Find the equation of $C_1$ and $C_2$.
            \item Denote the closest point on $C_1$ to $M$ by $X$, and that on $C_2$ to $M$ by $Y$. What is the geometric relationship between $A$, $B$, $X$, $Y$, $M$?
            \item Find the equation of circle with radius $XM$ and center $M$.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Denote the circle in (2c) by $C_0$. Denote the intersection points of $C_0$ and $L$ by $H$ and $K$. \begin{enumerate}
            \item Find the equations of tangent to $C_0$ at $H$,$K$,$X$,$Y$.
            \item Find the area enclosed by the above tangent lines and $C_0$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
